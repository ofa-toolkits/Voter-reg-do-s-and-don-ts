OFA VOLUNTEER VOTER REGISTRATION DO’s and DON’Ts

Every state has different rules regarding voter registration and voter registration drives. Some states, for example, limit to what extent a person can directly assist another person with the registration process. So it’s important that what you are doing is focused on directing people toward the resources they need to make sure they are registered to vote and their voter registration information is accurate.  

With that in mind, here are some general DO’s and DON’Ts:

DO

* Ask participants to use their own smartphone, tablet or computer. 

    * *You can lend the participant your smartphone, tablet or computer to use if the participant does not have one available

* Do direct participants to my.ofa.us/Register where they can register themselves to vote

* Do send people to their Secretary of State’s website for any questions

* Do check your state’s Secretary of State’s website for voter registration deadlines

* Do have fun!

DONT’S

* Don’t ever assist participants in filling out or completing their voter registration form 

    * Don’t fill out any part of the form for them

    * Don’t hit the submit button for them

    * Don’t print participant forms for them

* Don’t use paper forms -- following Vote.org’s online process helps keep you on the right side of state laws.

* Don’t take a paper form from anyone and offer to mail it or deliver it for them

* Don’t answer any voter registration questions -- send people to their Secretary of State’s website

* Don’t offer anything of value in exchange for asking people to register. That includes buttons, food, stickers or anything that would imply an incentive to register to vote.

* Don’t decline to lend your device to any participant or decline to direct any participant to my.ofa.us/Register based on their political party preference or any other factor. Always treat all participants equally if they are interested in registering to vote.
